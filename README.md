# VACLPGv2: passive vactrol low-pass gate 

This is pretty much your bog-standard vactrol LPG - there's an 'external' pot for CV level and in contrast to its predecessor, the trim control is broken out - this will control the amount of current through the LED part of the vactrol (this also affects the signal LED). You can switch between two capacitors to alter the character of the output (on pre-built modules, the values are 47nF and 470nF - if you're DIYing, you can use whatever feels right based on whatever type of vactrol you choose to use)

Since this is a passive module, you may need to add a bit of post-amplification to the output - something like my vBST module will handle that quite nicely.
